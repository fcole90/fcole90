#### Web-app to understand why some users "lie" to AI agents
Check out my work on a web application to study users' behaviour in interactive Machine Learning at "[**A!** Aalto University](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/)":
  - 💡 Users may "lie" to an AI agent, [see why and how!](https://fcole90.github.io/interactive_bayesian_optimization/)
  - 👆 Try the app yourself with the (serverless) [interactive demo](https://fcole90.github.io/interactive_bayesian_optimization/demo.html)!
  - 📺 I presented this work at the UMAP 2020 conference. [Watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/4noJRNVK9Ro)
